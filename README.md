# Bank-Loan-Project
This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of loan data to derive key insights and performance indicators for a banking institution. The analysis is done across various aspects of loan applications, funding, repayment, and loan portfolio quality assessment.

## Introduction
In today's dynamic financial landscape, banks and lending institutions face the challenge of effectively managing their loan portfolios while maintaining profitability and minimizing risks. The Bank Loan Project seeks to address these challenges by leveraging data analytics techniques to extract actionable insights from loan data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of loan data comprising 38,577 rows and 27 columns. The columns include essential attributes such as ID, address, state, application type, employment length, loan grade, home ownership status, issue date, loan status, loan amount, interest rate, annual income, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), installment amount.

## Analysis Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights related to loan applications, funding, repayment, loan quality assessment, and portfolio management
These objectives include:
1.	Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period and monitor changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2.	Total Funded Amount: Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, analyze Month-over-Month (MoM) changes, and track funding trends.
3.	Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers, assess cash flow, and analyze changes MoM.
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans and monitor variations MoM to understand the cost of lending.
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to assess their financial health and track fluctuations MoM.
6.	Loan Status Grid View: Create a comprehensive report categorized by loan status to monitor key indicators associated with different loan statuses.
7.	Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIs: Distinguish between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria and calculate relevant KPIs for each category.
8.	Monthly Trends: Visualize monthly trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts over time to identify seasonality and long-term trends.
9.	Regional Analysis: Analyze lending metrics categorized by state to identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
10.	Loan Term Analysis: Depict loan statistics based on different loan terms to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

## Visualization Tools
The analysis utilizes Excel for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Various Excel features, including pivot tables, charts, and graphs, are employed to create insightful reports and dashboards that aid in decision-making and performance monitoring.
